# THIS A CMAKE VERSION OF EDFlib

# EDFlib

EDFlib is a programming library for C/C++ for reading and writing EDF+ and BDF+ files.
It also reads "old style" EDF and BDF files.
EDF means European Data Format. BDF is the 24-bits version of EDF.


## Usage

The library consists of only two files: `edflib.h` and `edflib.c`.

In order to use EDFlib, copy these two files to your project.
Include the file `edflib.h` in every source file from where you want to access the library.

Don't forget to tell your compiler that it must compile and link `edflib.c` (add it to
your makefile or buildscript). `edflib.c` needs to be compiled with the options
`-D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE`.

For example:

`gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE test_edflib.c edflib.c -lm -o test_edflib`

Compilation has been tested using GCC on Linux, Mingw-w64 on Windows, and LLVM GCC on OS X (Yosemite).

To understand how to use the library, read the comments in `edflib.h`.


## Examples

To build the examples: `make`

Each "generator" example creates an EDF+ or BDF+ file with sample signals.

`test_generator` shows how to use most of the functions provided by the library and generates an
EDF+ or BDF+ testfile with several sample signals.

`sine_generator` creates a BDF+ file containing the signal "sine", a 1 Hz sinoidal waveform with a
sample frequency of 2048 Hz.

`sweep_generator` creates a linear or logarithmic sweep through a range of frequencies in EDF+ or
BDF+ format.

Use EDFbrowser to view these files: http://www.teuniz.net/edfbrowser/

`test_edflib <filename> <signalnumber>` will print the properties of the EDF/BDF header, the
annotations, and the values of 200 samples of the chosen signal. For example, running
`test_generator` will produce the file `test_generator.edf`. Running `test_edflib test_generator.edf 6`
will show the header and first 200 samples of the "noise" signal:
`75  6  27  77  37  30  35  96  62  69  34  15  51  56  69  68  80  45 ...`

## Background info

In EDF, the sensitivity (e.g. uV/bit) and offset are stored using four parameters:
digital maximum and minimum, and physical maximum and minimum.
Here, digital means the raw data coming from a sensor or ADC. Physical means the units like uV.
The sensitivity in units/bit is calculated as follows:

units per bit = (physical max - physical min) / (digital max - digital min)

The digital offset is calculated as follows:

offset = (physical max / units per bit) - digital max

For a better explanation about the relation between digital data and physical data,
read the document "Coding Schemes Used with Data Converters" (PDF):

http://www.ti.com/general/docs/lit/getliterature.tsp?baseLiteratureNumber=sbaa042

An EDF file usually contains multiple so-called datarecords. One datarecord usually has a duration of one second (this is the default but it is not mandatory!).
In that case a file with a duration of five minutes contains 300 datarecords. The duration of a datarecord can be freely choosen but, if possible, use values from
0.1 to 1 second for easier handling. Just make sure that the total size of one datarecord, expressed in bytes, does not exceed 10MByte (15MBytes for BDF(+)).

The RECOMMENDATION of a maximum datarecordsize of 61440 bytes in the EDF and EDF+ specification was usefull in the time people were still using DOS as their main operating system.
Using DOS and fast (near) pointers (16-bit pointers), the maximum allocatable block of memory was 64KByte.
This is not a concern anymore so the maximum datarecord size now is limited to 10MByte for EDF(+) and 15MByte for BDF(+). This helps to accommodate for higher samplingrates
used by modern Analog to Digital Converters.

EDF header character encoding: The EDF specification says that only ASCII characters are allowed.
EDFlib will automatically convert characters with accents, umlauts, tilde, etc. to their "normal" equivalent without the accent/umlaut/tilde/etc.

The description/name of an EDF+ annotation on the other hand, is encoded in UTF-8.
